# Current Development Status - Benchmark 1 Real-Time Speech Recognition

## What We're Working On
**Benchmark 1: Real-time word-by-word speech recognition with instant visual feedback**

## Current Problem
- Web Speech API is getting stuck on the first word
- Case sensitivity issue: speech recognition returns lowercase, but we're comparing with mixed case
- Need case-insensitive word matching

## What We Just Implemented
1. **Replaced complex Whisper backend** with simple Web Speech API for instant feedback
2. **Word-by-word checking**: As user says each word, immediately mark green (correct) or orange (incorrect)
3. **Simple logic**: Find next unread word → compare spoken word → mark status → move to next word
4. **No backend dependency** for real-time feedback (backend stopped for now)

## Current Code Structure
- **File**: `/src/App.jsx`
- **Key function**: `checkWordsRealTime(spokenText)` - processes each spoken word
- **Word statuses**: Array where 0=unread, 1=correct(green), 2=incorrect(orange)
- **Web Speech API**: Using `webkitSpeechRecognition` for instant speech-to-text

## Immediate Fix Needed
**Case sensitivity problem in `checkWordsRealTime` function:**
```javascript
// Current code has case sensitivity issues
const expectedWord = words[nextUnreadIndex].toLowerCase().replace(/[.,!?;]/g, '')
const spokenWord = // needs to be properly lowercased
```

## Expected Behavior
1. User clicks "Start"
2. Says "Crows" → Should turn green instantly
3. Says "are" → Should turn green instantly
4. Says wrong word → Should turn orange, move to next word
5. Continue until all words are checked
6. Auto-stop when passage complete

## Test Passages (Random Selection)
1. Crows (about bird behavior)
2. Government (about laws and structures)
3. Digital Music Recording (about music technology)

## Next Steps After Fix
1. Test case-insensitive word matching
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Verify instant real-time feedback works
4. Optional: Add Whisper backend later for final analysis
